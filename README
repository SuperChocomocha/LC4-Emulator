LC4 Emulator

TODO: - CMPU and CMPIU do not work as intended
      - LDR and STR can read and write to code segments
      - 32-bit printf negative
      - doesn't quit if in script
      - segfaults on empty input (if user just presses Enter)

USAGE: - compiled using gcc Emulator.c -o Emulator
       
       - look at the included html files to see how the original PennSim
             works, this is to emulate PennSim
       - the load command is "ld" in PennSim, but "load" for this emulator

       - many times it will say
             "Error: attempting to access memory outside of code"
             when the continue command is issued, this is NOT a bug as
             PennSim would also give an error, HOWEVER if PennSim DOES NOT
             give an error when the emulator DOES, then that IS a bug as
             the emulator should mimic PennSim
